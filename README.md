## Project Overview

Webisy is an automated static website generator built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It empowers users, developers, and non-developers alike, to effortlessly create customized static websites using a range of pre-built components.

## Features

- **Component Library:** Choose from a variety of components to build your static website.
- **Code Customization:** Utilize the integrated code editor to tailor the generated code to your preferences.
- **Next.js Integration:** Leverage the power of Next.js for seamless website generation and deployment.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Enhance your website's appearance with the flexibility of Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
